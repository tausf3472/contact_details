# 📇 Contact Details Manager

A simple, efficient, and lightweight Python application to manage your address book.

* **Update & Delete:** Modify existing contact information or remove outdated entries to keep your list clean.
* **Persistent Storage:** Saves data securely using SQLite (or JSON/CSV), so your contacts remain intact between sessions.
* **Export Functionality:** Export your entire contact list to a CSV file for backup or use in other applications.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **Libraries:** `sqlite3` (for database management), `csv` (for exporting data), `re` (for email/phone validation)
